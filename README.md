## What is it?

JIIT-PVQ is a web application designed exclusively to help Jaypee Institute of Information Technology students find previous year question papers. With JIIT-PVQ, students can easily check if question papers are available, and if they are, request PDF files to be sent directly to their college email addresses. Additionally, if a question paper is not available, students can fill out a form to request its upload.

### Features
```
- Check if question papers are available.
- Request PDF files of question papers to be sent to college email addresses.
- Request the upload of question papers that are not yet available.
```

### How Upload Works?
When a student fills out the upload request form, we use our OCR to check whether the image is a valid question paper. If it is, we convert it to PDF format and save it in the file system. All Students can then access the uploaded question papers through the web application.
